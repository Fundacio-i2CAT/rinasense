Sensor IoT based on RINA Architecture
====================

The development of this sensor is part of the H2020 Terminet project. The RINA-based IoT sensor is a set of libraries to enable the implementation of a RINA architecture. The RINA IoT architecture is implemented in conjunction with the IoT gateway based on IRATI open source component. In this way, IoT devices will be capable of using RINA flows to transport data to the IoT gateways based on IRATI. The RINA-based IoT sensor is targeted to FreeRTOS real time operative system. Particularly, it will be implemented using a ESP32 SoC. Also, it will be enabled to operate using the 802.11 and 802.15.4 standards, which are the most relevant standard used by the project use cases.
